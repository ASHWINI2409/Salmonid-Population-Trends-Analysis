# Salmonid-Population-Trends-Analysis
Analyzed salmonid population data from WDFW focusing on escapement and hatchery-origin spawners (pHOS). Used Python for data cleaning, visualization, and insights into species trends. Highlights population health, hatchery impact, and conservation efforts across Washington regions and years.

üêü Salmonid Population Trends Analysis
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of salmonid population indicators using the publicly available dataset from the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW). The dataset primarily focuses on two critical metrics

Escapement: The number of adult salmon that escape capture and return to freshwater habitats to spawn naturally.

pHOS (Proportion of Hatchery-Origin Spawners): The percentage of spawning fish that originated from hatcheries, a key measure used to assess the genetic integrity of wild populations and monitor hatchery influence on natural ecosystems.

üìä Objective
The primary goal of this project is to derive meaningful insights from long-term salmonid population data. By examining escapement trends and pHOS values across various regions and species, we aim to:

Understand the health and sustainability of wild salmonid populations.

Monitor the impact of hatchery programs on native spawning.

Visualize key trends over time and location.

Provide actionable information for ecological research and conservation planning.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies
This project was developed using the following tools:

Python

Pandas ‚Äì for data wrangling and analysis

Matplotlib & Seaborn ‚Äì for visualizations and trend analysis

Jupyter Notebook ‚Äì for developing and documenting the analysis process

üßº Data Cleaning & Preparation
The original CSV dataset contained numerous attributes, including species type, escapement numbers, pHOS values, water body names, and geographical details. Key preprocessing steps included:

Handling missing values and NaNs

Standardizing column names and data formats

Filtering out irrelevant or duplicate records

Converting date/time and regional fields for temporal and spatial analysis

üìà Key Analysis Highlights
Trend Analysis: Line plots and bar graphs illustrate escapement numbers across years, helping identify population booms or declines.

Hatchery Impact: pHOS values were visualized to determine areas with high hatchery influence, allowing comparison with escapement figures.

Regional Focus: The data was grouped and compared across different regions and water bodies in Washington state.

Species Comparison: Trends were broken down by salmonid species, offering insight into which populations are most at risk.

üåø Insights & Conclusion
Certain regions consistently show high pHOS values, indicating strong hatchery presence.

Some natural spawning populations have fluctuating escapement levels, possibly linked to habitat conditions, climate variability, or fishing pressure.

Areas with lower pHOS are crucial for maintaining wild genetic stocks and require continued monitoring and protection.

The results can help support conservation strategies, guide hatchery management policies, and inform the public and stakeholders about the state of local fish populations.
